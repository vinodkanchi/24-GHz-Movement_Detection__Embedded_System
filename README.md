# 24-GHz-Movement_Detection__Embedded_System
The project is movement detection system where we design a PCB board for a Bandpass filter for allowing specific frequency using KiCad, then we do an embedded detection system using FreeSo-2, here we use ADC,DAC and LED's. Finally the next step is to test the model for the required frequency and gain measurements.
